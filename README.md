System Design

1. Components

Camera System: Captures images of vehicles and sends them to the LPR Service.

LPR Service (License Plate Recognition): A gRPC service that processes images to extract license plate numbers.

Payment Service: A gRPC service that checks if the license plate has made a payment by querying a database.

Gate Control Service: A gRPC service that controls the gate based on the payment status.

API Gateway: A Spring Boot application that acts as the entry point for the system, routing requests to the appropriate gRPC services.

Service Discovery: Use Spring Cloud Netflix Eureka or Consul for service discovery and load balancing.

Database: PostgreSQL

2. Workflow 
    1. The camera captures an image and sends it to the API Gateway.

    2. The API Gateway forwards the image to the LPR Service.

    3. The LPR Service extracts the license plate number and sends it to the Payment Service.

    4. The Payment Service queries the database and returns the payment status to the API Gateway.

    5. The API Gateway sends the payment status to the Gate Control Service.

    6. The Gate Control Service opens or closes the gate based on the payment status.

3. Technologies
Spring Boot: For building microservices.

gRPC: For RPC communication between services.

Spring Cloud Netflix Eureka: For service discovery.

PostgreSQL: For the payment database.

Docker: For containerization.

Kubernetes: For orchestration (optional).
